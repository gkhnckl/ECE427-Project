    "You will form teams of three people to collaborate on this project.  Collaboration between teams is discouraged.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Files:**  \n",
    "This Julia notebook template (which you will use as a template for your report) and the network data files for the Wisconsin power system are available on the course website.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Project Deliverables:**  \n",

    "### Project Description\n",
    "  \n",
    "The energy future of Wisconsin is in your hands! You and your partners have been tasked with developing a plan to for the future grid in Wisconsin. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will first analyse the **current and future electricity generation in Wisconsin**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from an older model of the Wisconsin grid (provided by us below), you will research the generation mix (type and location of generators) has changed in recent years and will be changing in the near future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you will look into options for how to continue to serve electric load in Wisconsin (i.e., build new generation, build new transmission lines, plan to rely more/less on electricity imports). Here you can both consider projects that have already happened or are under construction/planning, or you can propose your own solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will **design the future Wisconsin grid**. This involves making updates to the Wisconsin grid model to reflect your analysis above and make sure that the grid can operate in a safe manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this design, you will need to propose the generation technology, siting and capacity of the different energy sources, and suggest locations for new transmission lines. At the same time, you have to consider the cost of implementing your plan. Remember that renewable energy such as wind or solar generation vary over time. Your upgrade plan can also include the installation of new transmission lines.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "For your grid design, you are asked to plan for two different days:  \n",
    "1.\tA stormy winter day with little sun, but a lot of wind where the load is higher than usual due to low temperatures.\n",
    "2.\tA sunny summer day with a lot of sun, but less wind where the load is high due to high temperature!\n",
    "  \n",
    "The resulting system must keep all transmission line flows and voltages within limits. Remember that you have to find **one** upgrade solution that works both in summer and in winter. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal and emphasis:**  \n",
    "The goal of this study is to create a good plan for the future Wisconsin grid, while taking into account changes that are already ongoing. This very short study (1 month) is directed more heavily on **power flow feasibility** of your plan, and it is intended to highlight some of the challenges and opportunities that arise with renewable energy sources.  Researching, discussing, and proposing a feasible solution that provides power to everyone in Wisconsin both in the summer and in the winter is needed to complete the project.  The cost of such a project is not inconsequential and should be considered and discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first main task of this project is to researching information about the current and near-future state of the grid in Wisconsin, as well as information necessary to make a reasonable, cost efficient plan to add generation and extend the transmission grid. This includes   \n",
    "• Properties of wind power: siting, cost, capacity factors, etc.  \n",
    "• Properties of solar power: siting, cost, capacity factors, etc.  \n",
    "• Other generation sources, etc.  \n",
    "• Cost of building new transmission lines.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The second main task of the project is to ensure that your proposed solution is feasible, meaning that you can provide a feasible generation dispatch where (1) generators operate within their bounds, (2) the power flow on all transmission lines is within the limits and (3) all voltage magnitudes remain in the range between 0.95 and 1.05 pu (which is tighter than the existing limits, meaning we want to make the voltages better than they currently are!).\n",
    "\n",
    "In your report, remember to discuss the following:  \n",
    "• Explain your choice of location for renewable energy (or other replacement generation). For renewable energy, the location for the new generation needs to make sense.  For example, to assess wind power potential, you can refer to the Wind Resource Maps of Wisconsin, or other similar resources you may find. Likewise for solar and other sources.     \n",
    "• This is a costly project. Remember to consider the cost of implementing your plan when designing the new energy system.  \n",
    "• Discuss any challenges and solutions to ensure that voltages and power flows remain within acceptable limits.  \n",
    "• How does your siting choices impact the power flows and voltages in the grid?  \n",
    "• Consider practical difficulties that might hinder your plan.  \n",
    "• Other important issues that can’t be covered in an idealized limited-time project. If there are things that you think should be considered in this project (in a real-life situation), but you cannot include due to lack of time or report length, mention those issues in your report.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**  \n",
    "• The target is 20 years in the future, so you can be creative and consider emerging technology for your design.   \n",
    "• For simplicity, you can assume that the power consumption is the same in summer and winter.  \n",
    "• Electrical parameters and limits for upgraded transmission lines or new transmission lines should be consistent with those appearing on similar lines in the existing model (and/or justified by appropriate references).  \n",

    "\n",
    "During the poster sessions, we will split the class in two. Groups 1-8 will present their posters from 1-1.30pm, while the students from groups 9-16 will visit their posters, ask questions and do a peer evaluation. \n",

Discuss how to make the presentation such that everyone in the group gets to present some part of the project.   \n",
    "\n",
    "When you create your virtual poster, remember that the screen is small, but it is allowed to zoom in and out. You can also keep additional \"backup material\" on hand that you can use to explain more details if the visitors to your poster have specific questions.\n"
